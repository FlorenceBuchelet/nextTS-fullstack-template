## Next.js

This [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## SQLite

SQLite is an integrated simple database.

**Note**: to navigate your SQLite database, you might want to use an IDE extension and therefore might need to install SQLite3 globally (`sudo apt install sqlite3` on Linux, via Homebrew on Mac and via the official `.exe` for Windows)
